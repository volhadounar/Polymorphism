# In the early stages of Pythonâ€™s type hints, the system was mainly nominal.
# The type-hinting system continued to evolve, and now it also supports a structural type system 
# -  class can replace another if both have the same structure.
# Since Python 3.8, the static type checkers started to support structural subtyping, 
# which means that they check whether objects are of a specific nominal type and also whether they meet the requirement to be of a given structural type.
